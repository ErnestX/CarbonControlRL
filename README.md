Use the DesignBuilder's example file: under floor heating example

Make sure energy plus 9.4 is selected in tools -> program options

Modify the design builder file as needed

File -> export -> energy plus -> simulation

In export options: 
	A lot of options to choose from! 
	In Output tab, Miscellaneous, check EDD/RDD file if needed (slightly slows down the simulation)
